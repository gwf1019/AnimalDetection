## Markdown

Markdown is an easy to read and write text format:

- It's _plain text_ so works well with version control
- It can be **rendered** into HTML, PDF, and more

## Our Topic

Image detection and classification is important in a multitude of areas, from determining if a dollar bill is real or counterfeit to identifying cells in our body as benign or cancerous to telling apart a cat from a dog.

## Our Goal

We used unstructured data containing hundreds of images from the following 6 animals. We ultimately hope to be able to develop a model which accurately detects and classifies each of these animals.

## Code Cell

Here is a Python code cell:

```{python}
import os
os.cpu_count()
```

## Equation

Use LaTeX to write equations:

$$
\chi' = \sum_{i=1}^n k_i s_i^2
$$
